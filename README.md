This is a simple quiz app styled like the popular game show Are You Smarter Than A Fifth Grader? It tests
your knowledge on elementary school curriculum-(history, science, geography, social studies, and mathematics).

I build this application out of a desire to create something that my family and friends could interact with. 
Seeing screenshots of the scores they recieve makes my day. 

This project was created for entertainment purposes, but could also be considered educational. Once you
click the link below you will be directed to the first question in the quiz. Be sure to select an answer
so that you can hit submit and move on to the next question.

Technologies used: JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. 

This app is still in the development process. I adjust the database and add functionality.
